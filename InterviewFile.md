## OOP

- Create your own data structures
- Includes data to describe the object
- Includes funtions to control the instance
- Create relationships between objects
- Supports inheritance - inherit functions to save typing them out

### OOP Four Pillars

- Encapsulation - data is hidden from other classes and only accessable from the class
- Abstraction - hide the details of how the code works from the user or other code
- Inheritance - Add the functions to a child class
- Polymorphism - can share data add functions but have different functionality
